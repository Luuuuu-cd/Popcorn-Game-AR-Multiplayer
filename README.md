# Popcorn-Game-AR-Multiplayer

This is a student project.

Problem-Statement:
Hospitalized kids like those at GOSH need a way to socialize and entertain themselves. Currently, they are limited to board games and indoor games that limit their imagination and creative spirit that outdoor games can provide.

Project-Abstract:
Our solution is to create a synchronous multiplayer AR game that is imaginative and allows kids to socialize using this game. The game requires kids to catch popcorns that pop out of an open popcorn machine, within a given time limit, against other players.
